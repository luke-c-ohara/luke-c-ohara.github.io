                    <p class="large text-muted">Having been born in Leamington Spa many moons ago, I've lived most of my life in Somerset. After Graduating from Bournemouth University, I decided to move to the bright lights of London Town seeking fame and fortune. After years of searching, I've come to realise, fame and fortune doesn't bring happiness. Which leads me to today. In the recent past I'll completed a Web Development Bootcamp, easily the best 3 months of my adult life, and I'm now on a quest to find a business I can work for which shares my passion for learning and innovation<br><br>

                    Outside of work/learning I like nothing more than supporting my beloved Coventry City FC, spending time with family and friends and getting on the slopes when I get the chance.<br><br> Blog coming soon. Watch this space...</p>
