description: This site was created to allow users to store wifi credentials, should they return to a location with a different device. It also allows for sharing of this data with friends as well as finding networks that are close to you via Googlemaps.<br><br>My favourite part of the site is the autocompleting, multi-select search. When looking for friends to share a network with, it auto populates a list with people that match your input and it also allows you to select more than one person at a time for a better user experience.
